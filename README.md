# Inova Wait Time Tracker

Tracks wait times for Inova hospitals and sends notifications when they change.

The times supposedly update every 10 minutes.

Run with the following command:

`EMAIL_FROM="me@gmail.com" EMAIL_PASS="gmail-app-password" EMAIL_TO="some@email.com" STORE_FILE="/tmp/inova-wait.json" TRACK_IDS="4 6" ./inova-wait`
